These instructions are intended to get you started using Andes3 to solve
problems.

0.  Got to http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/login.html
     To see a list of problems, go to http://www.andestutor.org/sets/

1.  Define scalar variables using the Text Tool using sentences like
     the ones provided with the problem (the match does not have to be
    *exact*).

2.  When using text to define a variable, possible forms include:
	a.  "m is the mass of the ball"
	b.  "m: mass of the ball"
	c.  "m=mass of the ball:

3.  Define vector variables using the text box of the Vector Tool.  When you
     define a vector, variables for the magnitude, components, and angle 
     are defined automatically.  So, for vector F, the magnitude is F, 
     components F_x F_y, and angle \thetaF are defined.

4.  Define coordinate system before vectors using the Axes Tool.

5.  Write equations using the Equation Tool, but variables used must
     be previously defined.

6.  Double click on a text or equation box to make a correction, then reenter.

7.  Hit enter after entering any information in a text box.

8.  To find the numerical value of a quantity:
	a.  Enter equations and value assignments required to solve 
            for variable "V".
	b.  In an equation box enter "V=?"

9.  Enter the final answer in a text box in the form like 
     "answer:  1.23 m/s" or  "answer: v1=1.23 m/s"

                          Known Issues

There are plenty of known problems:
1.  The sentence matching for definitions is really primitive:
    definitions need to be pretty close to the "official Andes sentence"
    For now, a list of sentences is shown on the drawing "canvas."statement.
2.  If you get an unsolicited hint and later ask for help,
    you get the hint again.
3.  Multiple-choice and check boxes don't work.
4.  Solutions are not logged or saved.
5.  There is no mechanism for choosing a principle of physics.
6.  Math notation (esp. Greek letters) is not handled
7.  Problems where you need to draw a vector in an unknown direction
    don't work.

The biggest need right now, aside from fixing the above, is to
provide scaffolded problems, so that students can learn how to
use Andes.  See
http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/Documentation/AsuDocs/narrative-22.pdf
pages 16, 31 for a description of our proposed scaffolding mechanism.
